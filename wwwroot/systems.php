<p>I have a few passions in life that I don't always get to fuel.</p>

<h2>BBQ</h2>
<p>I really enjoy BBQ. I love the science, the taste, the experimenting, and - of course - cooking!</p>

<p>Whenever I get an unexpected bonus or windfall I will likely spend it here. I have several types of BBQ now, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kamado Joe - perfect for long smoking or if I want something very, very hot.</li>
<li>Weber Gas - brilliant for quickly cooking something with minimal fuss.</li>
<li>CADAC Safari - it folds up fairly small and works like a trooper - brilliant for camping!</li>
</ul>

<p>I have owned other BBQs and accessories, but these are the three I use throughout the year.</p>

<p>For the past few years I've even done my Christmas Goose / Turkey on the BBQ - you should totally try it too!</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>My home is very automated. I have all kinds of gizmos and gadgets. I've even created some of my own that I might share here one day.</p>

<p>Nothing brings me more joy than solving a problem if I can get my hands dirty to fix it. Writing code or building things is something I get lost in.</p>

<h2>Sustainability</h2>
<p>For a very long time I've struggled to live healthily and diet. I still do. Attaching this to sustainability though makes it easier for me.</p>

<p>I am not perfect, and do stupid things. But in general I want to leave this planet in a better state than I joined it - so if I can do little things to help then I will.</p>
