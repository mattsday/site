<p>Over the years I've run a number of systems. This page is what I use today.</p>

<h2>PC and Laptop</h2>
<p>I have a personal Dell XPS 13 laptop running Arch. I really like its combination of portability, performance, Linux compatibility and style. The keyboard isn't bad either!</p>
<p>For work I have a Lenovo X1 Carbon running Debian Testing (the Google standard Linux OS). It's pretty good too, although I dislike the placement of the fn key (which I've since fixed with a BIOS config change).</p>
<p>I'm still using my 8+ year old Desktop system with an old Intel Sandy Bridge i7 CPU. It's running <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> and many packages that make life joyful in the Linux world.</p>
<p>This server runs in Google Cloud and runs Arch Linux too - I moved from Debian as I wanted to live on the bleeding edge!</p>

<h2>Home Gadgets</h2>
<p>I take my AV semi-seriously. I sport a Sony 65 inch OLED TV connected to a Denon AVR-X2200W amp. I have my favourite gadgets connected, including my Nvidia Shield and PS4. Audio-wise, I have a pair of Tannoy Mercury V speakers, Onkyo surrounds + centre and a Cambridge Audio bass. I find the sound beyond pleasing.</p>
<p>My downstairs has been kept clean by a Roomba vacuum cleaner since 2008. The little guy might be getting old now and bumps in to things, but he's part of the family.</p>
<p>I also have a PS4, Xbox 360, Wii U and N64. I bought the N64 to re-experience retro gaming (remember when you could just jump in to a game without a 10 minute intro after a 30 minute install/patch routine?) GTA V is quite possibly the most fun I've had with a computer game since I left university. I adore the Mass Effect series, anything Elder Scrolls (yet to get in to the online version though) and Grand Theft Auto.</p>
<p>An Amazon Alexa keeps it all tied together, although it has a success rate of about 80%."

<h2>Phone</h2>
<p>I currently use a Google Pixel 2 XL- I'm a big "fandroid". Apps I use most include Fotmob, Firefox and few newsy apps.</p>

<h2>Cool Free Software</h2>
<p>Here is a list of software that I use on a daily basis and really, really like:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> - I use it as my primary text editor, especially when programming or making web pages. I tried GUI editors and found them restrictive or slow.:wq</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Firefox</a> - the best browser out there</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> - the best scripting language out there (ok, it probably isn't, but better the devil you know)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC Player</a> - great cross-platform media playback suite</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">GNU Wget</a> - the best download manager I've ever found - use it to download any non-trivial file</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.weechat.org/">Weechat</a> - the best IRC client I've ever used.</li>
    <li><a href="http://irssi.org/">irssi</a> - the second best IRC client I've ever used.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG)</a> - an excellent OpenPGP implementation. I <a href="pubkey">sign</a> all my outgoing email and non-trivial files.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a> - whilst de-facto now in any decent operating system, it is an incredibly useful piece of software. I use ssh and scp on a daily basis.</li>
    <li>... doubtless more I've neglected to include</li>
</ul>

<h2>Historical Systems</h2>
<p><strong>As of June 2019 I no longer use any Apple systems - their direction isn't aligned with what I think a computer should be (closed ecosystem in particular)</strong></p>
<h3>Hackintosh</h3>
<p>My primary computer today is an Intel i7-3770k running at 4.3Ghz, with 16Gb RAM and an Nvidia GTX 9800Ti graphics card. My motherboard is a Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD5H motherboard which has great overclocking options and loads of SATA ports. I use a Samsung SSD drive set up as 4Tb fusion drive (with a Seagate 4Tb 7200rpm spinning disk too) as my boot drive and four HDs for various storage needs (including one which runs Windows). Last time I checked I had over 10Tb total storage on my Hackintosh.</p>

<p>I put all this in a Coolermaster HAF X case, which has a stupid number of fans and keeps the overclock cool. I have a Corsair H100 series water cooler on the CPU which I've mounted to the top of the case. In all, things are pretty cool in there!</p>

<p>For more information on how I set this system up, see <a href="hackintosh">my guide</a></p>

<h3>MacBook</h3>
<p>I currently use a 15" MacBook Pro with retina as my primary work machine. As I spend a lot of time on the road, I find it perfect for transportation and powerful enough to connect to my home system. I love Mac OS X and genuinely think it is the best operating system on the market, bar none (and yes, I have used Windows 10 and thought it was OK - but if I had to stop using Macs I'd use a GNU/Linux distribution).</p>
